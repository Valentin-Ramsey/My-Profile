        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>
            I come from Geneva, Switzerland, and have lived my entire life there. 
            Dynamic, outgoing, and determined, I enjoy working in a team, adapt quickly to situations, and aim at delivering results above expectations. My sense of responsibility and hard work enable me to feel comfortable in any situation. I am currently undergoing a Bachelorâ€™s in Business and Hospitality Management at EHL Business School.

        <ul>
            <li id="boxe"><h3>Sport<br><img src="gants-de-boxe.jpeg" alt="Boxing gloves"></li></h3>
                <p>Sports have always played a pivotal role in my life, with a particular emphasis on boxing. Growing up with a father who was a semi-professional boxer, I have been immersed in the world of boxing from the very beginning. Observing his training sessions instilled in me not only a passion for the sport but also a deep appreciation for the discipline it demands. Boxing has been instrumental in enhancing my focus and precision, especially during the most stressful periods of my life.</p>
            <li id="finance"><h3>Finance<br><img src="finance.jpeg" alt="An image of an arrow"></li></h3>
                <p>I harbor a deep passion for finance, particularly the dynamics of markets, including the evolution of stocks and bonds and their responsiveness to global events. The intricate relationship between financial instruments and worldwide occurrences fascinates me, drawing me deeper into the complexities of how markets operate and are influenced by global affairs.</p>
            <li id="jaguar"><h3>Automobile<br><img src="jaguar.jpeg" alt="An image of a 1962 Jaguar"></li></h3>
                <p>Automobiles are not just a mode of transport in my life; they are the very essence of my passion. The symphony of a purring engine resonates with me on a profound level, capable of evoking a deep emotional response that can, at times, bring tears to my eyes.</p>
            <li id="bashhh"><h3>Entrepreneurship<br><img src="bashhh.jpeg" alt="my start-up logo"></li></h3>
                <p>Two years ago, I embarked on an entrepreneurial journey by co-founding a start-up named Bashhh. We are at the forefront of innovation, developing a social media application that revolutionizes the way people create events and forge new friendships. At its core, Bashhh leverages technology to connect like-minded individuals through the organization of various events, facilitating not just the sharing of interests, but the creation of meaningful connections in the digital age. This venture reflects a harmonious blend of my passion for technology and a commitment to enhancing social interaction in a world increasingly reliant on digital platforms for communication.</p>
            <li id="travel"><h3>Travel<br><img src="travel.jpeg" alt="A Picture taken from an airplane"></li></h3>
                <p>My passion for traveling has blessed me with the incredible opportunity to explore some of the most breathtaking destinations on the planet, including Botswana, Zimbabwe, the Bahamas, Thailand, among others. Each journey has been a mosaic of experiences, offering a glimpse into the diverse tapestry of cultures, landscapes, and histories that these countries boast. From the untamed beauty of Botswana's wildlife to the historic ruins of Zimbabwe, the pristine beaches of the Bahamas, and the vibrant street life of Thailand, my travels have been a series of unforgettable adventures that have enriched my understanding of the world and its myriad wonders. These experiences have not only satiated my wanderlust but have also deepened my appreciation for the planet's exquisite beauty and the diverse cultures that inhabit it.</p>
